* TODO Story
  A mysterious group known only as /The Company/ is behind a major conspiracy that will lead to world domination, and you know too much about them. You are being hunted, but death is not your destiny. /The Company/ believes anyone can be convinced to join them, and you're no different. They've captured and brough you to a remote location to teach compliance. You will be subjected to various forms of brainwashing and torture techniques. Will you succumb to /The Company/'s will, or will you dash their plans and take them out from inside?

*** The Company
   #+CAPTION: The Company.
   #+NAME: fig: the-company
   #+ATTR_LaTeX: :float nil :width 8cm
   [[./img/the-company.png]]

**** Backstory
     In 2018, World War III broke out. Nuclear war raged on for 15 years, destroying the vast majority of the planet and decimating the population to the hundreds of thousands. In the aftermath, a reconstructed, cyborg President Nixon gathered the remnants of the Illuminati and the Free Masons. The resulting merger is /The Company/. Biding their time, they gathered influence over the years. Now, in the year 2142, /The Company/ has complete anonymous control over the American world government, granting them free reign over North America.

**** Goals
     /The Company/ currently olds captive the continent of North America. Their ultimate goal is to overthrow the other two remaining world governments: China, and the Afindican Warlords as well as the rogue rebels in Antarctica: The Nomads.

**** Influence and Power
     Having complete anonymous control over North America gives them access to unlimited natural resources (but not rare metals). Using their cyborg technology, they have implanted control chips into the newest generation, giving them access to the largest standing army still in existence today. They utilize /The Program/ to recruite the best of the best of the previous generation, such as Axshun Jaxxon, Ben Benson, and Yoki Warrior.

*** Afindican Warlords

**** Backstory
     The remnants of the India and Africa have merged into one super-continent. They are the result of the tectonic plate shift after the Araibian Plate was nuked from orbit and sunk into the Earth, the massive heat from the Mantle fused the Indian and African tectonic plates into one massive plate that drifted into the center of the Atlantic Ocean. The result is Afindica. Then, the various warlords in the African tribes banded together to create the Afindican Warlords. The new country is the last place on Earth with natural resources. They are rich in Uranium, Cadmium, and other transition metals. They also have the last chicken farm in the world.

**** Goals
     Being the combination of Africans and Indians, they are a highly spiritual people that want to live simple and separate lives from the rest of the world. They simply want to be left alone.

**** Influence and Power
     Seeing as Afindica holds the only chickens and rare metals in the world, they have a strong monopoly on the world economy. The other world powers vie for the favor of the Afrindican Warlords. Thus, while they have little military might, they have total economic control.

*** The Chinese Conglomerate

**** Backstory
     Similar to The Company, the Chinese Conglomerate has complete control of the surviving Asian peoples since 2142. Their main activities are bargaining with the Afindian Warlords and engineering robot armies and workers. Because of the destruction of their homeland and the death of the planet, the Chinese Conglomerate seeks to explore a new home on the Moon.

**** Goals
     The Chinese Conglomerate just wants to leave Earth. There is nothing left for the Asian people. The Moon is the only solace from the desolace of Earth.

**** Influence and Power
     The Chinese Conglomerate has the world's largest cyborg army. This makes them the country with the strongest military might and scientific technology.

*** The Nomads

**** Backstory
     The Nomads are a rebellion which started in the wake of The Company's rise to power. They wage war on The Company and are the only group in the world that know of their plans. The Nomads commonly use guerilla tactics and subterfuge to slow down The Company's progression. They fly an orange flag with an white phoenix emblem stitched into the center which symbolizes the rebirth of the Earth's civilization and the burning passion of the people who form The Nomads. The Nomads are based in South America, a piece of land untouched by nuclear war. They use stolen stealth boats and ancient drug-smuggling submarines to reach the shores of North America unnoticed; then, they use repurposed retina scanners to identify people who work at The Company.

**** Goals
     The Nomads want to strike back at The Company for instigating the devastating nuclear war. The Nomads are made up of the group of survivors that were ravaged by The Company. Their sole driving force is to dismantle The Company in pure revenge.

**** Influence and Power
     Being a relatively small and rogue operation, The Nomads have little political influence, yet they retain massive through knowledge and stealth. While not being able to connect politically with the other world powers, they still are able to conduct trade and avoid the wrath of The Company.
     
*** Mittens

   [[./img/mittens.png]]

**** Backstory
     Mittens is an alien cat that was experimented on in Area 51 under The Company's orders. During an attack on Area 51 by the Nomads, he was released and now resides in the Rocky Mountains. Whenever he gets wind of an abduction by The Company, Mittens will use his telepathic powers to communicate with the abductees to assist them in escaping the clutches of The Company.

**** Goals
     Mittens wants revenge on The Company for ordering the gruesome imprisonment and the painful torture experiments. His only goal is to destroy The Company. Without his people, he is weak. He aims to take down The Company by empowering The Nomads.

**** Influence and Power
     Because Mittens is a secret alien, not many know of his existence. Only those in the Nomad council know of Mittens because the Area 51 staff were all killed in The Nomad attack. Still, Mittens has great power, despite his weak influence. He has alien telekinetic and telepathic abilities.

* TODO Puzzle Types
** Acrostic
   There will be two pages appearing in the room for this puzzle. The first page contains clue phrases that, when answered, provide a mapping of letters to numbers (See Figure [[fig: acrostic-1]]). The second page has a series of blank spaces and numbers (See Figure [[fig: acrostic-2]]) that make a sentence when the mapping from page 1 is applied (See Figure [[fig: acrostic-3]]). The results of this puzzle will be a number for the key or a hint for another puzzle.

** TODO Block and Key
    There will be six *1 foot* cubes spread across the room. The player will need to place and orient these blocks on a pedestal to create an image by aligning the engravings on each cube. The opposite side of the cube array will then reveal an answer required to escape the room.

** TODO Cryptogram
    Encrypted messages that need to be put through a cipher in order to be easily read.

** TODO Connect the Dots
    Images drawn may be of other objects in the room. Different shaped dots (e.g. square vs. circle) will connect to make different images. A key will be placed in the room to indicate which dots make the correct image.
