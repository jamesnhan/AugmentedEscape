\section{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Story}
\label{sec:orga79e8c8}
A mysterious group known only as \emph{The Company} is behind a major conspiracy that will lead to world domination, and you know too much about them. You are being hunted, but death is not your destiny. \emph{The Company} believes anyone can be convinced to join them, and you're no different. They've captured and brough you to a remote location to teach compliance. You will be subjected to various forms of brainwashing and torture techniques. Will you succumb to \emph{The Company}'s will, or will you dash their plans and take them out from inside?

The Company.}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Backstory
\label{sec:orgd6138e5}
In 2018, World War III broke out. Nuclear war raged on for 15 years, destroying the vast majority of the planet and decimating the population to the hundreds of thousands. In the aftermath, a reconstructed, cyborg President Nixon gathered the remnants of the Illuminati and the Free Masons. The resulting merger is \emph{The Company}. Biding their time, they gathered influence over the years. Now, in the year 2142, \emph{The Company} has complete anonymous control over the American world government, granting them free reign over North America.

\item Goals
\label{sec:orga2627d4}
\emph{The Company} currently olds captive the continent of North America. Their ultimate goal is to overthrow the other two remaining world governments: China, and the Afindican Warlords as well as the rogue rebels in Antarctica: The Nomads.

\item Influence and Power
\label{sec:orgbd553f1}
Having complete anonymous control over North America gives them access to unlimited natural resources (but not rare metals). Using their cyborg technology, they have implanted control chips into the newest generation, giving them access to the largest standing army still in existence today. They utilize \emph{The Program} to recruite the best of the best of the previous generation, such as Axshun Jaxxon, Ben Benson, and Yoki Warrior.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} Afindican Warlords}
\label{sec:orgcf66af5}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Backstory
\label{sec:org69327fe}
The remnants of the India and Africa have merged into one super-continent. They are the result of the tectonic plate shift after the Araibian Plate was nuked from orbit and sunk into the Earth, the massive heat from the Mantle fused the Indian and African tectonic plates into one massive plate that drifted into the center of the Atlantic Ocean. The result is Afindica. Then, the various warlords in the African tribes banded together to create the Afindican Warlords. The new country is the last place on Earth with natural resources. They are rich in Uranium, Cadmium, and other transition metals. They also have the last chicken farm in the world.

\item Goals
\label{sec:org945d661}
Being the combination of Africans and Indians, they are a highly spiritual people that want to live simple and separate lives from the rest of the world. They simply want to be left alone.

\item Influence and Power
\label{sec:org4e66baa}
Seeing as Afindica holds the only chickens and rare metals in the world, they have a strong monopoly on the world economy. The other world powers vie for the favor of the Afrindican Warlords. Thus, while they have little military might, they have total economic control.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} The Chinese Conglomerate}
\label{sec:org7ce8e57}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Backstory
\label{sec:org9808352}
Similar to The Company, the Chinese Conglomerate has complete control of the surviving Asian peoples since 2142. Their main activities are bargaining with the Afindian Warlords and engineering robot armies and workers. Because of the destruction of their homeland and the death of the planet, the Chinese Conglomerate seeks to explore a new home on the Moon.

\item Goals
\label{sec:orgf474617}
The Chinese Conglomerate just wants to leave Earth. There is nothing left for the Asian people. The Moon is the only solace from the desolace of Earth.

\item Influence and Power
\label{sec:org7a15cdc}
The Chinese Conglomerate has the world's largest cyborg army. This makes them the country with the strongest military might and scientific technology.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} The Nomads}
\label{sec:org0b8d6bd}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Backstory
\label{sec:orgff65e6f}
The Nomads are a rebellion which started in the wake of The Company's rise to power. They wage war on The Company and are the only group in the world that know of their plans. The Nomads commonly use guerilla tactics and subterfuge to slow down The Company's progression. They fly an orange flag with an white phoenix emblem stitched into the center which symbolizes the rebirth of the Earth's civilization and the burning passion of the people who form The Nomads. The Nomads are based in South America, a piece of land untouched by nuclear war. They use stolen stealth boats and ancient drug-smuggling submarines to reach the shores of North America unnoticed; then, they use repurposed retina scanners to identify people who work at The Company.

\item Goals
\label{sec:orgcfc7736}
The Nomads want to strike back at The Company for instigating the devastating nuclear war. The Nomads are made up of the group of survivors that were ravaged by The Company. Their sole driving force is to dismantle The Company in pure revenge.

\item Influence and Power
\label{sec:orgecb33ef}
Being a relatively small and rogue operation, The Nomads have little political influence, yet they retain massive through knowledge and stealth. While not being able to connect politically with the other world powers, they still are able to conduct trade and avoid the wrath of The Company.

\captionof{figure}{\label{fig:org7e2a87a}
Mittens, the Alien Cat.}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Backstory
\label{sec:org6958fce}
Mittens is an alien cat that was experimented on in Area 51 under The Company's orders. During an attack on Area 51 by the Nomads, he was released and now resides in the Rocky Mountains. Whenever he gets wind of an abduction by The Company, Mittens will use his telepathic powers to communicate with the abductees to assist them in escaping the clutches of The Company.

\item Goals
\label{sec:orgbf5eff9}
Mittens wants revenge on The Company for ordering the gruesome imprisonment and the painful torture experiments. His only goal is to destroy The Company. Without his people, he is weak. He aims to take down The Company by empowering The Nomads.

\item Influence and Power
\label{sec:org2574cc1}
Because Mittens is a secret alien, not many know of his existence. Only those in the Nomad council know of Mittens because the Area 51 staff were all killed in The Nomad attack. Still, Mittens has great power, despite his weak influence. He has alien telekinetic and telepathic abilities.

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Mechanics}
\label{sec:org46777b4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Single player.
\item Puzzle solving.
\item Room is mapped by the HoloLens and augmented to match a scenario.
\item 3-4 puzzles placed around the room randomly.
\item Each puzzle gives a piece of the answer to escaping the current room.
\item Puzzles will be interactable 3D objects in augmented reality.
\item Once all puzzles of a room are solved, their answers can be entered into the door (keys, lock code).
\item Some puzzles and rooms will have random components in order to prevent "trial and error" attempts through the game.
\item Entering a wrong room answer will result in a \textbf{1 minute penalty}.
\item Players will have \textbf{1 hour} to solve all puzzles in all rooms.
\item Scenarios will contain \textbf{3 rooms} each.
\item All rooms must be completed within the time limit to complete the scenario.
\item Upon advancing to a new room in the game, the HoloLens will remap the current room the player is in.
\begin{itemize}
\item The player does not have to change rooms themselves.
\end{itemize}
\item Upon successful completion of the scenario, a story prompt will be shown to the player describing the events that follow the escape.
\item At \textbf{50 minutes} remaining, Mittens will appear to give the players a hint in case they're stuck.
\begin{itemize}
\item If a hint is given, Mittens will disappear and reappear at \textbf{40}, \textbf{30}, \textbf{25}, \textbf{15}, and \textbf{10} minutes remaining.
\item Hints will be consistent for each playthrough of the same scenario.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Goals}
\label{sec:org3f1af4b}
\begin{itemize}
\item Players win the game if they manage to escape the scenario within an hour.
\item After winning, an expository paragraph will be shown to the player to describe what happens following the escape.
\item Players lose if time expires.
\item After losing, an expository paragraph will be shown to the player to describe what happens to them after their escape fails.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Hints}
\label{sec:org89df1c5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mittens can give the player several types of hints after the player answers a riddle.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Remove Decoys}: Remove all or some of the decoys in the room.
\item \textbf{Puzzle Explanation}: Explain part of a puzzle to make it easier for the player to solve.
\item \textbf{Answer Location}: Place a glow on an object required for a puzzle.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Puzzle Types}
\label{sec:org14efb35}
\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} Acrostic}
\label{sec:org1eb99a7}
There will be two pages appearing in the room for this puzzle. The first page contains clue phrases that, when answered, provide a mapping of letters to numbers (See Figure \ref{fig:org6fff3a1}). The second page has a series of blank spaces and numbers (See Figure \ref{fig:orgfd74c4e}) that make a sentence when the mapping from page 1 is applied (See Figure \ref{fig:orgfe1bdc9}). The results of this puzzle will be a number for the key or a hint for another puzzle.

\end{center}

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily DONE} Rope Chain}
\label{sec:orgf1e9b04}
There will be four \textbf{20 foot} ropes each with four pegs spaced at different distances apart attached along the rope. Only one rope will have the exact peg separation required to insert each peg into four anchored podiums across the room.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./img/pt-rc-001.png}
\captionof{figure}{\label{fig:org84e2b46}

\end{center}

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Block and Key}
\label{sec:orgd2bf218}
There will be six \textbf{1 foot} cubes spread across the room. The player will need to place and orient these blocks on a pedestal to create an image by aligning the engravings on each cube. The opposite side of the cube array will then reveal an answer required to escape the room.

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Cryptogram}
\label{sec:org06474f3}
Encrypted messages that need to be put through a cipher in order to be easily read.

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Connect the Dots}
\label{sec:orgb7769f9}
Images drawn may be of other objects in the room. Different shaped dots (e.g. square vs. circle) will connect to make different images. A key will be placed in the room to indicate which dots make the correct image.

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Statues/Totems}
\label{sec:org62881ca}
\textbf{3-4} statues or obelisks with images need to be positioned in a particular way to unlock an answer. There will be an image, that may or may not be the result of the solution of another puzzle, depicting how to orient the statues around the room.
